This code is a collection of C source files for a graphical user interface (GUI) application.

The "graphics.c" file contains functions and data structures for creating and manipulating graphical elements such as windows, buttons, and text boxes.

The "font.c" file includes definitions for different fonts that can be used in the GUI.

The "input.c" file has functions for handling user input, such as mouse clicks and keyboard events.

The "graphics_elements.c" file contains code for creating more complex graphical elements, such as progress bars, dropdown menus, and sliders.

The "task.c" file includes functions for managing and switching between different tasks or processes in the GUI application.

Finally, the "main.c" file is the entry point for the program, where the GUI is initialized and run.
